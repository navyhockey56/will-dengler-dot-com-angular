          I started off my college adventure at Colorado College. I came into the school without the slightest idea as to what I wanted to study, much less what I wanted to do after college. However, that all changed during my first block sophomore year when I took the introduction to computer science course. Prior to my first computer science course, I had never written any code; much less believed that I'd be any good at it. During that course, I fell in love with programming: it's utility, the way it makes you think, the joy and satisfaction gained from creating something out of nothing but your thoughts. To say the least, I found everything about programming incredibly alluring and I knew I wanted to spend my days doing it profressionally. It was this new-found passion for programming that ultimately led me to transfer away from Colorado College to the University of Mayland - a school known for it's impressive computer science track.

          Transferring to UMD was probably the best decision I made when it came to my education. When I first arrived at UMD, it looked as if I was no longer going to graduate on time due to my transfer. However, due to a wierd loophole that allowed certain upper-level mathematics courses to also count towards the computer science track, it turned out that the scheduling at the school would allow me to graduate on time with a computer science degree if only if I double majored in mathematics. Having a strong desire not to "fall behind" by graduating a semester or two late, I decided that I would earn a mathemetics degree alongside my computer science degree. This worked out wonderfully for me, I consistently found that the creative and theoretical thinking involved in my mathematics courses strengthened my ability to grasp computer science topics; simultaneously, the constructive and detail-oriented thinking involved in my computer science courses helped a great deal when facing more challenging mathematical proofs. In the end, I was able to graduate on time with both degrees and a burning passion for both subjects.

          About a week after graduation, I started my career at Sapio Sciences as a "Junior Programming Consultant". Sapio Sciences is in the business of building out the computer systems that medical research laboratories use to store their data, track their progress on experiments, etc. The formal term for this type of system is "Laboratory Information Management System" or "LIMS" for short. As a programming consultant, I was tasked with meeting with our clients to gather requirements for their specific lab, and then converting these requirements into code that would extend the functionality of the LIMS to meet their specific needs.

          The constant back and forth with customers taught me a great deal about how to effectively gather requirements from a non-technical persons as well as sharpened my ability to explain technical topics to these same people. In hindsight, working with customers directly was the most beneficial experience I had at Sapio Sciences.

          Like most recent-graduates, I had little understanding of how professional software development was actually done. I had never worked with a dependency management system and my knowledge of the command line was limited to say the least. This quickly changed as time passed and I grew into my role. As a java shop, Sapio was using Ivy as it's dependency management system. I soon realized this was a bit outdated, and started talking with my coworkers about upgrading to Maven instead. I found a compatriot amongst the ranks, and the two of us took it upon ourselves to convert the projects we were working on to use Maven. This became a far greater task than we originally planned since Sapio used non-industry standard practices for the deployments of their jar dependencies. We were ultimately able to overcome the challenges we faced by producing custom maven MOJOs that accounted for the quirks in our build and deployments, and were able to successfully convert our projects to Maven. Afterwards, we took it upon ourselves to hold a few meetings with the rest of the developers to explain what we had done and get them to convert their projects to maven as well. In the end, our efforts were well worth it - the other developers got on board and we converted the company to using Maven. The end result was a much faster build process, and a massive reduction in "jar hell".

          After a year and half working for Sapio Sciences and living in York, PA, I found myself craving a more vibrant social life. As such, I started applying to jobs in the DC area and ultimately ended up at Jibe.
