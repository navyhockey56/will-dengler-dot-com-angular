        Hi there! On first glance this page may look like a resume; however, it isn't quite that... This page has less of a focus on things I accomplished and technologies I used as you'd find in a resume; instead, this page is more akin to the story of my how I got where I am today. If you are more interested in resume-themed writing, I encourage you to consult my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-dengler-a69952139/">LinkedIn</a>.

      <h3>Education</h3>

        <h5>Colorado College</h5>
        <p><i>Fall 2013 - Spring 2015</i></p>
        <p>
          I started off my college adventure at Colorado College. I came into the school without the slightest idea as to what I wanted to study, much less what I wanted to do after college. However, that all changed during my first block sophomore year when I took the introduction to computer science course. Prior to my first computer science course, I had never written any code; much less believed that I'd be any good at it. During that course, I fell in love with programming: it's utility, the way it makes you think, the joy and satisfaction gained from creating something out of nothing but your thoughts. To say the least, I found everything about programming incredibly alluring and I knew I wanted to spend my days doing it profressionally. It was this new-found passion for programming that ultimately led me to transfer away from Colorado College to the University of Mayland - a school known for it's impressive computer science track.

          Transferring to UMD was probably the best decision I made when it came to my education. When I first arrived at UMD, it looked as if I was no longer going to graduate on time due to my transfer. However, due to a wierd loophole that allowed certain upper-level mathematics courses to also count towards the computer science track, it turned out that the scheduling at the school would allow me to graduate on time with a computer science degree if only if I double majored in mathematics. Having a strong desire not to "fall behind" by graduating a semester or two late, I decided that I would earn a mathemetics degree alongside my computer science degree. This worked out wonderfully for me, I consistently found that the creative and theoretical thinking involved in my mathematics courses strengthened my ability to grasp computer science topics; simultaneously, the constructive and detail-oriented thinking involved in my computer science courses helped a great deal when facing more challenging mathematical proofs. In the end, I was able to graduate on time with both degrees and a burning passion for both subjects.

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Sapio Sciences</h5>
        <p><i>May 2017 - October 2018</i></p>
        <p>
          About a week after graduation, I started my career at Sapio Sciences as a "Junior Programming Consultant". Sapio Sciences is in the business of building out the computer systems that medical research laboratories use to store their data, track their progress on experiments, etc. The formal term for this type of system is "Laboratory Information Management System" or "LIMS" for short. As a programming consultant, I was tasked with meeting with our clients to gather requirements for their specific lab, and then converting these requirements into code that would extend the functionality of the LIMS to meet their specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constant back and forth with customers taught me a great deal about how to effectively gather requirements from a non-technical persons as well as sharpened my ability to explain technical topics to these same people. In hindsight, working with customers directly was the most beneficial experience I had at Sapio Sciences.

          Like most recent-graduates, I had little understanding of how professional software development was actually done. I had never worked with a dependency management system and my knowledge of the command line was limited to say the least. This quickly changed as time passed and I grew into my role. As a java shop, Sapio was using Ivy as it's dependency management system. I soon realized this was a bit outdated, and started talking with my coworkers about upgrading to Maven instead. I found a compatriot amongst the ranks, and the two of us took it upon ourselves to convert the projects we were working on to use Maven. This became a far greater task than we originally planned since Sapio used non-industry standard practices for the deployments of their jar dependencies. We were ultimately able to overcome the challenges we faced by producing custom maven MOJOs that accounted for the quirks in our build and deployments, and were able to successfully convert our projects to Maven. Afterwards, we took it upon ourselves to hold a few meetings with the rest of the developers to explain what we had done and get them to convert their projects to maven as well. In the end, our efforts were well worth it - the other developers got on board and we converted the company to using Maven. The end result was a much faster build process, and a massive reduction in "jar hell".

          After a year and half working for Sapio Sciences and living in York, PA, I found myself craving a more vibrant social life. As such, I started applying to jobs in the DC area and ultimately ended up at Jibe.

        <p><i>November 2018 - Present</i></p>
        <p>
          After leaving Sapio Sciences, I headed for DC to start work as a software engineer for Jibe on their Integrations team. Jibe provided recruiting services to companies, with a focus on creating career sites that supported job searching and the handling of job applications. Systems that support such things are often referred to as Application Tracking Systems, or ATSs for short. However, Jibe wasn't quite an ATS... Instead, Jibe was uniquely positioned as a middle man between an ATS and it's customer. You see, many companies purchased ATSs awhile ago and were either locked into a long-term contract or had a large recruitment team already trained on their pre-existing ATS and were reluctant to have them re-trained. This is where Jibe comes in, we provided our customers a modern, mobile friendly career site equipped with SEO, job searching, and application handling without them having to leave their current ATS. How did we do this? Well, instead of being just another ATS ourselves, Jibe would pull the jobs from the existing ATS and their application flows, and then host them on our career site. When applications came in, we would submit them to the ATS we had pulled the job from. Now this is where the integrations team comes in, it was our responsibilty to import the jobs from the ATSs as well as submit the applciations back to those ATSs. In June 2019, Jibe was acquired by iCIMS; as such, I still do the same thing at iCIMS as I did at Jibe, only now my team is called the ATS Bridge and I received a promotion to software engineer II.

          Unlike Sapio Sciences, the integrations team predominantly coded in ruby. Prior to starting, I had only coded in ruby for two weeks during a summer course at UMD. To prepare myself for the position, I read through <a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/" target="_blank">"Programming Ruby - The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide"</a>, which I found to be an absolutely fantastic guide to the ruby langauge. Within the first week, I already started to feel confident using ruby; as such, I highly encourage anyone interested in learning ruby to give the guide a try! As time passed, I found myself enjoying ruby more and more; even to this day, my fondness for the language continues to grow. With ruby, I find their is no friction between ideas and code. The lack of friction makes coding in ruby incredibly efficient, and quite frankly, a lot of fun! I definitely encourage anyone interested in learning to program to give ruby a try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far, I have found my time in my current role invaluable. The nature of our work constantly offers unique problems to solve; most notably how to submit applications to an ATS without an API and how to keep our career sites up to date with the everchanging data on an ATS. Problems such as these require novel solutions and constant iteration; and I have definitely grown as an engineer because of them.

          I don't know where life where take me next, much less when that'll be. In the meantime, I plan to continue to expand my abilities through my work and side projects; and have a good time doing it!
