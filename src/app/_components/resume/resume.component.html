        Hi there! On first glance this page may look like a resume; however, it isn't quite that... This page is more akin to the story of my how I got where I am today. If you are more interested in resume-themed writing, I encourage you to consult my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-dengler-a69952139/">LinkedIn</a>.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Colorado College</h5>
        <p><i>Fall 2013 - Spring 2015</i></p>
        <p>
          I started off my college adventure at Colorado College. I came into the school without the slightest idea as to what I wanted to study, much less what I wanted to do after college. However, that all changed when I took the introduction to computer science course first thing sophomore year. Prior to my first computer science course, I had never written any code, much less believed that I'd be any good at it. During that first computer science course, I fell in love with programming. I loved the way programming makes you think, it's near-infinite utility, and the blissful satisfication derived from creating things with your thoughts. To say the least, I had become quite enchanted, and from that point forward, I knew I wanted to spend my days doing programming. It was this new-found passion for programming that ultimately led me to transfer away from Colorado College to the University of Mayland - a school known for it's impressive computer science track.

          Transferring to UMD was probably the best decision I made when it came to my education. When I first arrived at UMD, I was concerned I would not be able to graduate on time due to my transfer. However, it turned out that the scheduling at UMD would allow me to graduate on time if and only if I double majored in mathematics. Having a strong desire not to "fall behind" by graduating a semester or two late, I decided that I would double major in mathematics. Double majoring not only allowed me to graduate on time, but I also consistently found that the creative and theoretical thinking involved in my mathematics courses strengthened my ability to grasp computer science topics; simultaneously, the constructive and detail-oriented thinking involved in my computer science courses strengthened my problem-solving skills, giving me the ability to solve the more challenging math proofs I faced. By the time I left UMD, I had developed a life-long passion for both mathematics and computer science.

      <h3>Work</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <h5>Sapio Sciences</h5>
        <p><i>May 2017 - October 2018</i></p>
        <p>
          About a week after graduation, I started my career at Sapio Sciences as a "Junior Programming Consultant". Sapio Sciences is in the business of building out the computer systems that medical research laboratories use to store their data, track their progress on experiments, etc. The formal term for this type of system is "Laboratory Information Management System" or "LIMS" for short. As a programming consultant, I was tasked with meeting with our clients to gather requirements for their specific lab, and then converting these requirements into code that would extend the functionality of the LIMS to meet their specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constant back and forth with customers taught me a great deal about how to effectively gather requirements from a non-technical persons as well as sharpened my ability to explain technical topics to these same people. In hindsight, working with customers directly was the most beneficial experience I had at Sapio Sciences.

          After a year and half of living in York, PA, I found myself craving a more vibrant social life. As such, I started applying to jobs in the DC area and ultimately ended up at Jibe.

        <p>
          After leaving Sapio Sciences, I headed for DC to start work as a software engineer for Jibe on their Integrations team. Jibe provided recruiting services to companies, with a focus on creating career sites that supported job searching and the handling of job applications. Systems that support such things are often referred to as Application Tracking Systems, or ATSs for short. However, Jibe wasn't quite an ATS... Instead, Jibe was uniquely positioned as a middle man between an ATS and it's customer. You see, many companies purchased ATSs awhile ago and were either locked into a long-term contract or had a large recruitment team already trained on their pre-existing ATS and were reluctant to have them re-trained. This is where Jibe comes in, we provided our customers a modern, mobile friendly career site equipped with SEO, job searching, and application handling without them having to leave their current ATS. How did we do this? Well, instead of being just another ATS ourselves, Jibe would pull the jobs from the existing ATS and their application flows, and then host them on our career site. When applications came in, we would submit them to the ATS we had pulled the job from. As the Integrations team, it was our responsibilty to import the jobs from each ATS as well as submit the applciations back to it's ATS of origin. In June 2019, Jibe was acquired by iCIMS; as such, I still do the same thing at iCIMS as I did at Jibe, only now my team is called the ATS Bridge and I received a promotion to software engineer II.

          Unlike Sapio Sciences, the integrations team predominantly codes in ruby. Prior to starting, I had only written ruby for two weeks during a summer course at UMD. To prepare myself for the position, I read through <a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/" target="_blank">"Programming Ruby - The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide"</a>, which I found to be an absolutely fantastic guide to the ruby langauge. Within the first week, I already started to feel confident using ruby; I highly encourage anyone interested in learning ruby to give the guide a try! As time passed, I found myself enjoying ruby more and more; even to this day, my fondness for the language continues to grow. With ruby, I find their is no friction between ideas and code. The lack of friction makes coding incredibly efficient, and quite frankly, a lot of fun! I definitely encourage anyone interested in learning to program to give ruby a try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus far, I have found my time in my current role invaluable. The nature of our work constantly offers unique problems to solve; most notably how to submit applications to an ATS without an API and how to keep our career sites up to date with the everchanging data on an ATS. Problems such as these require novel solutions and constant iteration; and I have definitely grown as an engineer because of them.

          I don't know where life where take me next, much less when that'll be. In the meantime, I plan to continue to expand my abilities through my work and side projects; and have a good time doing it!
