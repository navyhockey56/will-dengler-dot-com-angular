          <a href="https://awkwardmath.com" target="_blank">Awkward Math</a> is my website dedicated to my love for mathemetics. On awkward math, you can find articles I've written on mathematics, learn about <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com/awkward_state_machines#theory" target="_blank">Awkward State Machines</a>, and create <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com/colorgraphing#console" target="_blank">Color Graphs</a>!

          Awkward Math's website is built with React. My decision to use React was not necessarily a carefully weighed one. Prior to building the site, I hadn't really done any modern web development. However, I breifly worked on a project that used React at my job, and that motivated me to want to learn more; and what better way to learn than to do? To make styling the site easier, particularly for mobile devices, I decided to use React Bootstrap. Having only taken an introduction to HTML and javascript class in college, I was fairly enchanted with React when first working on the site. Things such as no longer having to copy and paste the navbar onto every page, and the mixing of components with their logic, made using React a far more enjoyable experience than my previous exursions with just HTML and jquery.

          Awkward Math uses an AWS lambda function to produce it's color graphs, AWS DynamoDB to cache results, and AWS S3 to store the created graphs. The decision to use AWS was motivated by the computational power required to create a color graph. You see, the typical graph requires calculating several million mathematical operations. As such, I needed a beefy computer to run the graphing program; however, I also did not want to spend a bunch of money. AWS Lambda became the godsend I needed to make color graphing a realty online; with Lambda, I get to run the color graphing program on a beefy computer, but am only billed for the time I use. Furthermore, if there was ever a spike in usage, Lambda will automatically scale out more computers to run the graphing program; relieving me of the burden of worrying my box will fall over due to too many requests. Once I made the decision to use Lambda to produce my graphs, I started to research the other AWS offerings. I quickly found that I could use API Gateway to kick off my lambda function, S3 to store my produced graphs, and DynamoDB to cache results; altogether, I would be able to run color graphs without having to manage a backend of my own. Not having to build and manage a backend allowed me to get color graphing online much more quickly, with a stability I would have been unable to match myself at the time.

          Since learning to do so, I've always loved proving things, and have had an obsession with trying to discover new things in mathematics. Inspired by my applications of linear alegebra course, I devised the method for producing color graphs my senior year of college. The thrill associated with discovering a new thing in mathematics was intoxicating. Since then, I've occassionaly dove head-first into math projects in my free time. I take a particular interest in topics where I can develop theory that can later be translated into a software program, allowing me to add some show to my tell. Other than color graphing, two of these deep-dives have made their way onto Awkward Math thus far. In the spring of 2019, one of my coworkers expressed interest in learning more upper-level mathematics. This prompted me to write <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com/articles/art_of_math_proof" target="_blank">The Art of Mathematical Proof</a> in attempt to convey what a mathematical proof is and how one goes about proving things themselves. The following summer, I found myself thinking about prime numbers and wound up discovering <a href="https://www.awkwardmath.com/awkward_state_machines#theory" target="_blank">Awkward State Machines</a> - a state-based graph capable of producing the prime numbers without the use of arithemetic (as well as an infinite number of infinite series of numbers just as bizzarre as the primes!). Having a strong desire to share my article, color graphs, and awkward state machines with the world, I created the Awkward Math website.

          Currently, Awkward Math is on the back-burner as I focus on developing <a routerLink="/side-projects/side-texter">Side Texter</a>, but I intend to come back to it soon. I'd love to add more articles and interractive components; and the site could definitely use some love in the styling department.
