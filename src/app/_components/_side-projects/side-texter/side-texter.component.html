        <h4>Inception</h4>
        <p>
          It was about 3AM and I was having trouble sleeping around Thanksgiving 2019. After it became clear to me that I wasn't going to get back to sleep anytime soon, I decided to pull out my laptop to try to entertain myself. After failing to find a good article to read, I thought the best way to pass the time would be to write some code. Wanting to work on something fun and easy, my mind wandered towards Twilio: wouldn't it be cool to be able to send myself a text programmatically, I thought to myself. The next thing I know, I'm fumbling around in the dark looking for my wallet so I can enter my credit card info into my new Twilio account. Within the next twenty minutes, I had written a tiny ruby script to send myself the message "When you're up early and bored, then you might as well learn how to send text messages programmatically! - yourself". I lay in there in my bed looking at the short script I had just hacked together, "Sending a text message can't be this easy", I remember thinking. As I started to type the command into my console to run the script, that brief jolt of excitement and anxiety overtook me, "Is it going to work?!", I pressed enter. Within the next couple of seconds my phone lit up, and with it, so did my excitement; I had just received a text message from myself!

        <h6>A Side Project is Born</h6>
        <p>
          One of my favorite things about software is that there seems to always be new things to learn. Since starting programming, I've been working to gather the necessary skills to handle full stack development. I've found that the most effective to develope these skills is through various side projects that capture my interest. With the ability to programmatically text now in my pocket, I realized I had a great opportunity to work on these skills. I decided that creating a website where people could easily purchase phone numbers and send text messages would be a great project to continue my efforts. I decided to name the project Side Texter.

        <p>
          Side Texter presented me with several problems to solve; many of which it would be my first time encountering them. Fortunately, with no pressure to complete the project in a timely manner; I welcomed the prospect at learning so many new things. To complete the most basic vision for my project, I would need to build and deploy a website as well as a backend server for it to talk to. Easy said, not so easy done. Up to this point in my software adventures, I had only used Netlify to deploy a website, written a mere few lines of SQL, and the closest I'd gotten to deploying my own server was creating an AWS Lambda function. You might be thinking that I could easily use similar tools once again, thus saving me the effort of learning new things and allowing me to complete my project more quickly. Well, you're absolutely right; however, doing so would drastistically dilute the knowledge I would acquire throughout the project.
        </p>
        <h6>Decisions, Decisions</h6>
        <p>
          With a strong desire to maximize my learning, I needed to decide where to focus my efforts; I knew if I reached for too much at once, I would risk overwhelming myself and becoming demotivated. With this in mind, it was easy to make the decision to write my backend in ruby in order to prevent wasted cycles getting comfortable with a new language. Having decided on ruby, you might may be thinking that the obvious choice would then to be use rails to write my server. Ultimately, the server would become a rails application; however, not as quickly as one might suspect. As mentioned previously, I had very little experience with SQL and managing databases in general. With the capabilities of Active Record, this lack of experience wouldn't matter too much since the SQL is abstracted far, far away. However, I didn't want to miss the opportunity to fill a long-stading gap in my knowledge. As such, I decided to write the first version of my backend as a sinatra application that would use nothing but the pg gem to manipulate a postgresql database; knowing full well that I would eventually need to rewrite the application in rails if I ever wanted to operate in a production setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having settled on an initial backend, it was time to consider how I wanted to write my frontend. At this point in software journey, I had a little experience writing simple HTML and Javascript; and also had spent some time with React from creating <a routerLink="/side-projects/awkward-math">Awkward Math</a>. Despite these past experiences, frontend development was still fairly new to me; and I was staring down my most complicated frontend project to date. As such, my initial thought was to use React to invoke a similar home-field advantage that had influenced my decision to use ruby on the backend. However, I really wasn't all too comfortable with React, so any home-field advantage would be minimal at best. My thoughts then came to the reccomendations of the front-end team from my job: nearly all the developers highly reccomended Angular. Having never worked with Angular, I couldn't really make an informed decision as to whether to use it over React; however, I could not ignore the advice of my coworkers. I decided to delay my decision until I knew a bit more about Angular. As such, I took a minor detour from Side Texter and spent a weekend following a rather in-depth tutorial to Angular. By the end of the tutorial, I was thoroughly enchanted with Angular. For the first time, front-end development felt less like the wild-west, and much more like the backend development I was used to; ultimately leading me to make the decision to write my front-end in Angular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having decided on the tools I would use to bring Side Texter to life, it was time to decide on the environment in which to do it. In the past, I had used tools such as Netlify to handle deploying my projects since they are incredibly easy to use and remove the need to understand linux. However, I had now spent a little over a year running Ubuntu on my home computer and the prospect of having my local environment match my production environment, as well as the ability to increase my familiarity with Linux, was too great an oppurtunity to pass over. After some cursory research, I stumbled upon Digital Ocean droplets: for just $5/month, I could ssh into a box running Ubuntu to do with whatever I pleased; I was instantly sold.
